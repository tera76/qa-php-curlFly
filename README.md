PHP contains an built-in web server for application development purpose. By using the -S option where addr:port point to a local address and port PHP will listen to HTTP requests on that address and port and serve files from the current working directory or the docroot passed by the -t option.

```console
cd qa-php-curlFly/
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
